Sample AngularJS and node.js JavaScript application scraping and displaying popular hikes.

By no means a completed, optimized, or efficient app--just testing out some node.js and other JavaScript libraries, leaving my thoughts as I go.

The AngularJS front end is served by node.js and express. It uses a static JSON file for data, since the scraper will almost always return the same data. The data.json file is slightly different than the scraped results, as the scraper is just a test bed that is still in progress.
